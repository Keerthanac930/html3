            alt="tiger is the national animal">
        <p>Tigers live in various habitats across Asia, primarily in countries like India, Russia, Nepal, and China. They inhabit a wide range of environments, from the snowy forests of the Russian Far East to the tropical forests and mangrove swamps of Southeast Asia and India. Historically, their range was much larger but has been significantly reduced due to human expansion.  
        </p>
        <p>igers have a very powerful roar. Their roar is so loud that it can be heard from miles away. Interestingly, these big cats can also produce low-pitched infrasonic sounds that are below the human hearing range. So, humans can't hear the sound, but can feel it.

        <p>Mango is the National fruit of India and it is one of the most favourite fruits. Mango is a tropical fruit, that is, it grows well in the warm climate of the tropics. Mostly mangoes are oval and the colour of mango skin varies from green, yellow to red and green. A mango has one big seed and the mango seed is inedible.
